Version 0.5.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2022-02-22

Version 0.5.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2021-11-08

Notes:
 * This release changes the default bootstrap variant to `buildd`, which may result
   in users needing to pass `--variant=none` to build with existing images, or change
   the default via Debspawn's global settings.
 * The image name and suite name have been decoupled, so users can now give images
   arbitrary names and create multiple ones for different purposes.

Features:
 * Allow custom container image names, decoupling them from being suite-based
 * Propagate proxy settings through to APT, debootstrap and nspawn
 * Default to the 'buildd' bootstrap variant
 * Make update-all command work with custom image names
 * Add global config option for default bootstrap variant

Bugfixes:
 * Give access to /boot as well if read-kmods is passed

 * run: Retrieve artifacts the same way as regular build artifacts
 * Unmount any bindmounds when cleaning up temporary directories
 * man: Document the SyscallFilter config option
 * man: Clarify new image name / suite relations in ds-create manual page
